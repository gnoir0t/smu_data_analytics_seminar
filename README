Grism spectroscopy for extragalactic astronomy, an how-to

Grism spectroscopy is a very efficient way to obtain up to thousands of galaxy spectra in a single exposure. In this seminar, we will briefly review this observing mode and present reduction and analysis techniques of grism data through practical jupyter notebooks. We will present an introduction to using the grism redshift and line analysis software Grizli (https://grizli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as well as examples of spectral energy distribution fitting using both grizli and the optimized sampling algorithm dynesty (https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
